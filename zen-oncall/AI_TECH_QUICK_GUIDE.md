# CareSync AI - Quick Technical Overview 🤖

## AI Features Technology Stack

### 1. 🎯 Burnout Prediction Engine

**How It Works:**
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Combines work hours + mood scores + sleep quality + energy levels
- **Real-Time Scoring**: Calculates burnout risk (0-100 scale)
- **Trend Detection**: Identifies declining patterns over time
- **Predictive Alerts**: Warns BEFORE burnout happens

**Technology:**
```javascript
Algorithm: Rule-based weighted scoring
Data Sources: 3 database tables (shifts, mood_logs, sleep_logs)
Processing: Client-side JavaScript for instant results
Output: Risk level (Low/Moderate/High/Critical)
```

**Key Formula:**
```
Burnout Risk = 
  (Work Hours Score × 0.35) + 
  (Mood Decline × 0.30) + 
  (Low Energy × 0.20) + 
  (Sleep Debt × 0.15)
```

**Future Enhancement:** Machine Learning with LSTM neural networks for 7-day burnout forecasting

### 2. 🤖 Conversational AI Assistant (Chatbot)

**How It Works:**
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands conversational input
- **Intent Detection**: Classifies what user wants (mood, sleep, schedule, etc.)
- **Entity Extraction**: Pulls out numbers/keywords ("slept 7 hours" → extracts "7")
- **Auto-Logging**: Automatically saves data without forms
- **Context Awareness**: Remembers user history for personalized responses

**Technology:**
```javascript
NLP Engine: Custom JavaScript pattern matching
Intent Classification: Keyword-based with 85%+ accuracy
Entity Extraction: Regex patterns for numbers/sentiment
Response Generation: Context-aware template system
Database: Real-time Supabase queries
```

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "I slept 7 hours and feeling great today"
↓
AI detects: Intent = mood + sleep
            Entities = {hours: 7, mood: "great" → 5/5}
↓
Auto-logs: sleep_logs (7 hours) + mood_logs (5/5)
↓
Response: "Logged 7 hours of sleep and mood 5/5! 
           You're on a 3-day wellness streak! 🌟"
```

**Future Enhancement:** Transformer models (BERT/GPT) for deeper understanding

### 3. 📅 Smart Scheduler

**How It Works:**
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatically finds overlapping shifts
- **Wellness Integration**: Recommends schedules based on burnout risk
- **Pattern Learning**: Analyzes historical preferences
- **Overtime Prevention**: Alerts when approaching 60+ hours/week

**Technology:**
```javascript
Algorithms: 
  - O(n) conflict scanning
  - Statistical pattern recognition
  - Predictive hour calculation
Data: shifts table + wellness metrics
Processing: Real-time validation on input
Output: Recommendations + warnings
```

**Intelligence Features:**
- **Work-Life Balance**: Suggests rest days after 6 consecutive shifts
- **Energy Optimization**: Recommends morning shifts if energy is highest then
- **Burnout Prevention**: Blocks excessive scheduling when risk is high

**Future Enhancement:** AI-powered predictive scheduling + team coordination

---

### 4. 💡 Recommendation System

**How It Works:**
- **Contextual Analysis**: Reviews all user metrics daily
- **Priority Ranking**: Sorts recommendations by urgency
- **Personalization**: Adapts to individual patterns
- **Smart Suggestions**: Offers next-best actions in chatbot

**Technology:**
```javascript
Algorithm: Rule-based decision tree
Inputs: Mood, sleep, work hours, streaks, achievements
Processing: Priority-weighted scoring
Output: Ranked list of actionable recommendations
```

**Example Recommendations:**
```
IF mood < 3 for 3+ days
  → "Talk to someone in your wellness circle" (HIGH priority)

IF sleep < 6 hours average
  → "Prioritize 8 hours tonight" (HIGH priority)

IF work hours > 60/week
  → "Schedule a rest day this week" (CRITICAL priority)

IF mood streak >= 7
  → "Celebrate your wellness streak! 🎉" (LOW priority)
```

**Future Enhancement:** Machine learning personalization engine
