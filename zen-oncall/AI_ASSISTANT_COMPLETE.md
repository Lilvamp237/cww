## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Database Integration**
```typescript
// Queries existing data for context
const { data: todayMood } = await supabase
  .from('mood_logs')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user?.id)
  .eq('log_date', today)
  .single();

// Inserts new records
await supabase.from('mood_logs').insert({
  user_id: user.id,
  mood_score: mood,
  energy_level: energy,
  log_date: today,
});
```

### **Intent Detection**
```typescript
// Mood logging with values extracted
const moodMatch = lowerMessage.match(/(awful|bad|okay|good|great)/i);
const energyMatch = lowerMessage.match(/energy.*?(\d)/i);

// Task creation with full sentence parsing
const taskMatch = lowerMessage.match(/(?:add task|remind me to)\s+(.+)/i);
```

### **Action System**
```typescript
const executeAction = async (action: string, data?: any) => {
  switch (action) {
    case 'quick_mood_log':
      await supabase.from('mood_logs').insert({...});
      break;
    case 'log_mood':
      router.push('/wellness-enhanced');
