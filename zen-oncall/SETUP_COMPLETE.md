- Loading states
- Empty states (delete all announcements)
- Privacy settings (toggle sharing)
- Date/time formatting
- Real-time updates (if implemented)

## 💡 Demo Tips

If you're showing this to someone:

1. **Start with Dashboard** - Show the overview and stats
2. **Go to Wellness** - Demo task management and habit tracking
3. **Open Scheduler** - Show calendar view and shared schedules
4. **Enter a Circle** - Demonstrate team collaboration features
5. **Create Something** - Live demo creating a task or announcement
6. **Show Shift Swap** - Explain the practical use case

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing?
- Run verification query in Supabase:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM circles;
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shifts;
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM personal_tasks;
  ```
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check RLS policies are enabled

### Can't See Other Users?
- This is normal! RLS (Row Level Security) is working
- You can only see data you have access to
- Circle members can see each other's shared data

### Environment Variables?
Check your `.env.local` file has:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key
```
