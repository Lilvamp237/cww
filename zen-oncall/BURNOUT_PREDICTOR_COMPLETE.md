## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Enhanced Algorithm (`lib/burnout.ts`)**

```typescript
export const calculateBurnoutScore = (
  shifts: Shift[], 
  moodLogs: MoodLog[],
  sleepLogs?: SleepLog[],
  tasks?: Task[],
  previousScore?: number
): BurnoutAnalysis
```

**Key Functions**:
1. `calculateDaysSinceLastBreak()` - Scans last 30 days for 2+ consecutive days off
2. Multi-factor scoring with weighted maximums
3. Proactive recommendation generation
4. Early warning detection
5. Trend calculation

### **Database Table (`burnout_scores`)**

```sql
CREATE TABLE burnout_scores (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users,
    score INTEGER NOT NULL,
    level TEXT CHECK (level IN ('Low', 'Moderate', 'High', 'Critical')),
    factors JSONB,
    recommendations JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Purpose**: Historical tracking of burnout scores over time for trend analysis.

### **Page Component (`/burnout/page.tsx`)**

**Data Loading**:
- Fetches last 7 days of shifts, mood logs, sleep logs
- Fetches all tasks (for overdue calculation)
- Fetches previous burnout score for trend

**State Management**:
- `burnoutData` - Current analysis results
- `previousScore` - For trend comparison
- `loading` - Loading state
- `lastChecked` - Timestamp of analysis

**Refresh**: Manual refresh button re-runs full analysis

## üì± Integration Points

### **Dashboard Card** (`/dashboard`)
Shows quick summary:
- Risk level
- Risk color
- Main message
- Button ‚Üí "View Full Analysis" ‚Üí `/burnout`

### **Navbar**
